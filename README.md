# Portfolio

you can install the final version of the portfolio and launch it on your computer for now,
to deploy my portfolio I used vercel in which I integrated Checkly, I added some apps to my repository including imgbot to manage my images and maintain their quality, checkly to check my script, github learning lab to support me in learning github and obviously vercel to deploy my site
